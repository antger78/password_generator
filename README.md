# Password Generator

# Description
The Password Generator creates a randomly generated password made to a users specifications.  Upon clicking "Generate Password," users will be prompted to select the number of characters, then click "ok" or "cancel" to the prompts indicating whether or not to include uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numberic characters, and symbols. If a user inputs a value other than an integer between 8 and 128, or puts in a string instead of an integer, there will be a prompt instructing user to put in a numeric character and the prompts will end and the user will need to begin again.
